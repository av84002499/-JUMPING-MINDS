Set up Django Project:

Create a new Django project using the django-admin startproject command.
Set up the Django REST Framework (DRF) in the project by adding 'rest_framework' to the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py.
Configure the database settings in settings.py (e.g., using PostgreSQL).
Optionally, set up Redis for caching if needed.
Create Models:

Create an Elevator model with fields like status (up, down, stopped), current_floor, etc.
Create a UserRequest model with fields like source_floor, destination_floor, timestamp, etc.
Create Serializers:

Create serializers for the Elevator and UserRequest models using Django REST Framework serializers.
Implement API Views and Viewsets:

Implement API views/viewsets for initializing the elevator system with 'n' elevators.
Implement API views/viewsets for fetching all requests for a given elevator.
Implement API views/viewsets for fetching the next destination floor for a given elevator.
Implement API views/viewsets for fetching if the elevator is moving up or down currently.
Implement API views/viewsets for saving user requests to the list of requests for an elevator.
Implement API views/viewsets for marking an elevator as not working or in maintenance.
Implement API views/viewsets for opening/closing the door.
Database and Redis Setup:

Set up the PostgreSQL database for the project (if not using the default SQLite).
Set up Redis (if needed) for caching and improved performance.
Comments and Documentation:

Add comments throughout the codebase to explain complex logic or functionalities.
Document the APIs and their usage in the codebase.
Write clear and descriptive function/class/method docstrings.
Create a well-structured README.md file with detailed explanations of the project, design decisions, API contracts, and instructions for setting up, deploying, and testing the project.
Testing and Integration:

Test the APIs thoroughly, covering various edge cases and scenarios.
Create a short video demonstrating the use of the project and its APIs as expected.
